            New-user designs restricting to treatment initiators have become the preferred design for studying drug comparative safety and effectiveness using nonexperimental data. This design reduces confounding by indication and healthy-adherer bias at the cost of smaller study sizes and reduced external validity, particularly when assessing a newly approved treatment compared with standard treatment. The prevalent new-user design includes adopters of a new treatment who switched from or previously used standard treatment (i.e., the comparator), expanding study sample size and potentially broadening the study population for inference. Previous work has suggested the use of time-conditional propensity-score matching to mitigate prevalent user bias. In this study, we describe 3 “types” of initiators of a treatment: new users, direct switchers, and delayed switchers. Using these initiator types, we articulate the causal questions answered by the prevalent new-user design and compare them with those answered by the new-user design. We then show, using simulation, how conditioning on time since initiating the comparator (rather than full treatment history) can still result in a biased estimate of the treatment effect. When implemented properly, the prevalent new-user design estimates new and important causal effects distinct from the new-user design.},

	abstract = {Purpose Studies of the real-world comparative effectiveness of drugs conducted using computerized healthcare databases typically involve an incident new-user cohort design for head-to-head comparisons between two medications, using exclusively treatment-naïve patients. However, the desired contrast often involves one new drug compared with an older drug, of which many users of the new drug may have switched from, seriously restricting the scope of incident new-user studies. Methods We introduce prevalent new-user cohort designs for head-to-head comparative drug effect studies, where incident new users are scarce. We define time-based and prescription-based exposure sets to compute time-conditional propensity scores of initiating the newer drug and to identify matched subjects receiving the comparator drug. We illustrate this approach using data from the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink to evaluate whether the newer glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 analogs) used to treat type 2 diabetes increase the risk of heart failure, in comparison with the older similarly indicated sulfonylureas. Results Of the 170 031 users of antidiabetic agents from 2000 onwards, 79 682 used sulfonylureas (first use 2000), while 6196 used GLP-1 analogs (first use 2007), 75\% of which had previously used a sulfonylurea. After matching each GLP-1 analog user to a sulfonylurea user on the time-conditional propensity scores from prescription-based exposure sets, the hazard ratio of heart failure with GLP-1 use was 0.73 (95\%CI: 0.57–0.93). Conclusion The proposed prevalent new-user cohort design for comparative drug effects studies allows the use of all or most patients exposed to the newer drug, thus permitting a more comprehensive assessment of a new drug's safety.

	abstract = {The prevalent new-user cohort design is useful for assessing the effectiveness of a medication in the absence of an active comparator. Alternative approaches, particularly in the presence of informative censoring, include a variant of this design based on never users of the study drug and the marginal structural Cox model approach. We compared these approaches in assessing the effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in reducing mortality among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) using a cohort of IPF patients identified in the United Kingdom’s Clinical Practice Research Datalink and diagnosed between 2003 and 2016. The cohort included 2,944 IPF patients, 1,916 of whom initiated use of PPIs during follow-up. There were 2,136 deaths (mortality rate = 25.8 per 100 person-years). Using the conventional prevalent new-user design, we found a hazard ratio for death associated with PPI use compared with nonuse of 1.07 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.94, 1.22). The variant of the prevalent new-user design comparing PPI users with never users found a hazard ratio of 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.73, 0.91), while the marginal structural Cox model found a hazard ratio of 1.08 (95\% CI: 0.85, 1.38). The marginal structural model and the conventional prevalent new-user design, both accounting for informative censoring, produced similar results. However, the prevalent new-user design variant based on never users introduced selection bias and should be avoided.},
